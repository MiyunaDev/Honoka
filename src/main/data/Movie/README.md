# Movie or Series

## How to add?

1. Create a folder using the original title of the movie or series you own
2. If you have a series, add it like this

```
| This is my series title
-> Eps 1.mp4
-> Eps 2.mp4
```

or if you have a movie, add like this

```
| This is my movie title
-> Eps 1.mp4
````

The system will detect one video only in your movie directory so... You can see the directory like this


```
| Books
| Movies
-| My Series (2022)
--> Eps 1.mp4
--> Eps 2.mp4
-| My Movies (2023)
--> Eps 1.mp4
```

## What files are supported?

Video files are supported for `mp4` or `mkv` video formats only.

## Does it have to be set like that?

Actually, there is no rule for that. You can make it like anything. as long as there are numbers there. But the title must be exactly the same because the source is taken from the source you have.

But please note, Avoid number formats starting with 0 such as 01, 02 and others because it will make the system confused, and use strange symbols other than numbers.

-------

Use this system as wisely and well as possible.
