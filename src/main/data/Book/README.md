# Book or Sequel

## How to add

There are two ways you can use

### Book

1. Open the Book folder
2. Put your book file there

### Sequel

1. Open the book folder
2. Create a title name according to the original
3. Make the format more or less

```
| My sequel
-| Vol 1 Chapter 1.epub
```

You are free to name what. But the system will read the first number as part of each sequel respectively. Of course it's just a number. For example, if it is only named episode 1 / chapter 1, it will be considered as a stand-alone. However, if you give volume 1 episode 1 it will be considered where the volume will be the parent or special series grouped

## What files are supported?

Book files are supported for `epub` or `pdf` document formats only.

## Does it have to be set like that?

Actually, there is no rule for that. You can make it like anything. as long as there are numbers there. But the title must be exactly the same because the source is taken from the source you have.

But please note, Avoid number formats starting with 0 such as 01, 02 and others because it will make the system confused, and use strange symbols other than numbers.

-------

Use this system as wisely and well as possible.
